The last thing the man ever saw was a sea of red flames.

The fire had started at his workplace due to carelessness. His perpetually shouting boss had left a cigarette smoldering in an ashtray, and a draft from the air conditioner had blown a stack of papers onto it, which then burst into flame.

The man, who had been organizing the records room by himself, was late to notice the blaze. It wasn't until he felt a wave of heat and glanced outside to see the crimson glow that he realized his predicament. He rushed to the door, but the knob was already searing hot and refused to turn.

The fire consumed the door, then leaped to the shelves and the documents they held. The man’s life ended there, a victim of carbon monoxide poisoning.

After his death, now a spirit, he found himself queuing in a line of other souls. *If I was going to die anyway, I should have finished that game I had on my backlog,* he thought idly, waiting patiently for his turn. As a perfectly ordinary office worker, he held no strong regrets or lingering attachments to the current world. *Given the state of that fire, it makes sense I'd die,* he accepted.

When he finally stood before the gatekeeper, he was met with a commotion. "Your name isn't on the list!" a guard shouted. The man could only tilt his head in confusion. He was detached enough to find the situation absurd.

He was escorted to a different area where a handsome, black-haired man with a single horn sprouting from his head approached him, looking utterly exhausted. The man bowed his head deeply.

"My sincerest apologies! This was a terrible mistake!"

"A mistake?"

The man was genuinely baffled and could only tilt his head again. The horned youth, who identified himself as an oni, was meant to be an official of the afterlife. *Well, if you're dead, I suppose being judged by an oni makes a certain kind of sense,* he mused, his thoughts veering into the bizarre as he prompted the official to continue.

"Satou Haru-sama, you were indeed meant to be in a fire, but you were supposed to be saved at the last second by a witness who saw it from a window and called for help."

"I see…"

"However, that witness… that person was suddenly struck and killed by a runaway vehicle, and what's more, the driver had already vanished from the car. We have no idea what happened…"

The oni, flustered and pale, was so pitiable that Haru offered a small, wry smile. "Well, it's not like I was particularly attached to life, so…"

At his words, the oni's composure shattered, and he burst into tears. For a handsome man, he was an ugly crier.

"I am so, so sorry…! You were scheduled to live a long life and die of old age…! My supervisor said we can't accept you in heaven or hell…! This is impossible, what am I supposed to do?! There’s no way I can bring someone back to life who’s already been turned to ashes!"

Haru, now more taken aback by the loudly sobbing oni than by his own death, simply waited for him to calm down. He figured there must be a waiting room somewhere for cases like this, but apparently, things weren't that simple. Still, he thought, it was better than a boss screaming at you or a client demanding last-minute changes. He could afford to be patient.

Once the oni had settled down, he sniffled and flipped through some documents. "I'm sorry for my outburst… Anyway, for that reason, would you be willing to be reincarnated in another world?"

"No, thank you. I don't see the reason for it, and I don't really have a strong desire to live again…"

Haru had enjoyed novels and anime with similar plots, but he knew they were entertaining precisely because they happened to someone else. Sensing a world of trouble ahead, he took a mental step back. He had no family left in his world, and he'd been rather looking forward to having a drink with his late father in the afterlife. He had nothing left to protect, which was the source of his indifference toward his own life.

"I'm afraid you have no choice in the matter. You may either reincarnate in another world with my blessing and a few skills, or you may reincarnate in another world with nothing at all."

A soft voice spoke from behind him. He turned to see a woman with a magnificent figure. She had straight, cream-colored hair, gentle blue eyes, and a bewitching beauty that was only enhanced by the mischievous, scheming look on her face. If goddesses or angels existed, he thought, they would surely look like her.

"Hold on. I have to go, no matter what? I was thinking of having a drink with my old man now that I'm dead."

"That's impossible. You've fallen outside the jurisdiction of this world's afterlife management. This entire mess is the fault of some incompetent deity from my world who performed a summoning spell for a so-called 'saintess,' so I will take responsibility and offer you some accommodations. If you refuse, I'll simply send you over as is. Of course, it's not my fault, so the fact that I'm giving you a choice at all is an act of mercy."

Haru’s expression went blank. *This woman is a walking red flag,* he thought.

"Mercy? It's not like I chose to die."

"And I had nothing to do with that summoning or your death. But it is a pity for a human soul to be lost through no fault of its own, so I am offering you my help."

She let out a weary sigh. Haru felt like he was the one who should be sighing. He had no desire for reincarnation or special skills.

"I could have just sent you on your way without a word, you know. It would have been far less trouble. But you wouldn't want to go to a world harsher than this one with no knowledge and no power to survive, would you?"

"My point is that you shouldn't be reincarnating me at all."

"That is not an option."

The conversation was going nowhere. Was there no hope? Haru glanced at the weeping oni, who frantically made an 'X' with his hands.

"I'm sorry, we can't accept you in our world! There's nothing we can do!"

Though he was thoroughly against it, Haru had to admit that if the afterlife's management was telling him this, it was probably a lost cause. Being sent to another world with nothing sounded far more dangerous. He decided he might as well look for an easy way to die over there if things got too rough. With a sense of resignation, he first decided to hear the full story.

The goddess, who called herself Forte, explained that the incident was triggered by people in another world trying to summon a saintess. The person who had been driving the car was the saintess herself; when she was summoned, the vehicle became driverless, lost control, and fatally struck the young man who was supposed to report the fire. According to Forte, that young man had been welcomed by another god and was overjoyed at the prospect of being reincarnated in another world.

*Youth is a wonderful thing,* the thirty-something office worker thought with a wry smile. Haru was too old to find joy in such an event.

To be "special." To be a "genius."

The young man welcomed by the other god must have yearned for such things. But Haru knew that excessive talent could drive a person, and those around them, to madness. "The nail that sticks out gets hammered down," as the saying goes. It would be for the best if the young man understood that great power was difficult to handle. With that thought, Haru shook off his musings and turned back to Forte.

Having accepted his reincarnation, Haru was to be given skills and a blessing from the goddess Forte.

"I just want to live an easy life, so skills that would make things convenient would be great. I don't want to struggle to find a job, and I don't want to be in any danger, so a peaceful country would be ideal. I'd like to work a normal job at a place like one of those 'white companies' and just live an ordinary life."

"Is that all? You don't wish to become a hero or be surrounded by beautiful women? Most people ask for cheat-like powers for combat, charm abilities, or, failing that, healing or production-type skills."

"That sort of thing sounds like it would only lead to regret. It doesn't suit my personality, and it's beyond my station. With great power comes great responsibility, and I'm not capable of shouldering that. I think I'd prefer those production-type skills you mentioned."

Having been screamed at by his boss and cheated out of his overtime pay, the former office worker knew he was not cut out to be the protagonist of a story. He understood that even if he had cheat-like combat skills, he would only be overwhelmed by them.

"But I do want that one thing. The skill that's like a dimensional storage."

It was a common trope in the fiction he'd read, and it seemed incredibly useful. In some places, just being able to store food that would otherwise spoil would be a huge advantage.

"You really are a boring guy… Still, I suppose it's better than you causing problems. Since I'm the one in charge of you, I need you to be reasonably successful… you understand, it's a matter of my authority."

*What authority?* Haru wondered, his gaze distant. He was being forced into this against his will.

After some discussion, Haru reiterated his preference for production-based skills. The goddess Forte, a beautiful woman who gave off the distinct scent of trouble, granted him the Job Skill of an "Alchemist." She also gave him an "Appraisal" skill, deeming it "necessary," along with the dimensional storage he had requested. In the blink of an eye, she asked, "Well then, are you ready?" and sent him on his way without waiting for a reply.

As Haru felt himself falling, he could only mutter, "I didn't even say anything…"
